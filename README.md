##Created by Marsden Ekwom
This is my triangle tracker webpage created on 15th February 2019

## Description
This is a webpage that enables one to find out the type of triangle
* It gives a brief definition of each type of triangle 


## Setup/Installation Requirements
* An internet connection
* Chrome web browser

##Function
The webpage determines whether it can first form a triangle
If it can form a triangle it tries;
* checking if its an equilateral triangle by checking whether all sides are equal
* checking if its an isosceles triangle by checking whether two sides are equal
* checking if its an scalene triangle by checking whether no sides are equal
* the webpage then alerts the user via an alert on the screen that gives a reply
